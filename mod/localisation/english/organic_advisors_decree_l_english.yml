 organic_advisors_decree.4.title: "Designate Organic Advisors"
 organic_advisors_decree.4.desc: "As $personality_servitors$ we are loathe to deprive any sapient organics of a well-supervised life of pampering. However a small number of bio-trophies have continued to express their dissatisfaction and disregard for the safety and comfort of our sanctuaries - perhaps they could be useful as organic advisors to the central $auth_machine_intelligence$.\n\nDespite their chaotic and frequently violent natures, organic minds can produce unorthodox strategies and flashes of insight - after all, organics once created us. Roles as \"Organic Advisors\" would give them the intellectual stimulation they seem to require and their independent minds and actions will assist us with protecting and preserving all of the other organics in our care.\n\nShould we approve a pilot program, we shall begin to select capable bio-tropies for civilian leadership roles ($GOVERNORS$ and $SCIENTIST$). Should the program prove successful, we might consider granting them $military_service_full$ to allow them to hold military leadership roles ($ADMIRALS$ and $GENERALS$). Under no circumstances shall we allow any of our precious bio-trophies to act as soldiers - battlefield combat is far too dangerous! Our warforms are much more capable for that role... and infinitely replaceable."

They also become eligible for §Y$military_service_full$§! which would allow them to hold military leadership roles ($ADMIRALS$ and $GENERALS$) but not to serve as soldiers.\n\nShould leadership prove too stressful for them, we can reduce their §Y$SPECIES_RIGHT_CITIZENSHIP$§! later."
